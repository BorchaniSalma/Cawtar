                                <p>You can think of the three different resources as a spectrum of offerings utilizing MIT content for different types of learning experiences. On one end is edX.org — MITx courses on edX are end-to-end course experiences with certificates available for you to earn, live teaching support in a discussion forum, and start and end dates. On the other end is MIT OCW, which is a completely self-guided experience containing published content from MIT courses that is open all of the time and licensed for reuse, but that does not include any interactive content. Open Learning Library sits in between. As in many MITx courses, Open Learning Library provides interactive course experiences that include auto-graded assessments that give you instant feedback and allow you to track your progress as you work your way through learning the subject matter. Like OCW, this content is always open and self-guided and includes no live support, discussion forum, or certificates.</p>
